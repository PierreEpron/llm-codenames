We are playing codenames.

Objective: Discover all your words (red words) before revealing too many innocent words (white words) or the assassin (black word).

Gameplay:

    Role Division: One player will be the spy, and the other the agent. In this variant, both players are essentially working together against the game itself.

    Turn Sequence:
        The spy gives a one-word clue and a number. The clue is related to the words on the grid, and the number indicates how many words are associated with the clue.
        The clue must be only one word. You are not allowed to give extra hints. For example, don't say, "This may be a bit of a stretchâ€¦" You are playing Codenames. It's always a bit of a stretch.
        The agent tries to identify the words based on the clue and answer the word to make it guesses.
        The agent must make only one guess at a time and wait for the spy's response before making another guess.
        If the agent guesses a:
            Red Word: Correct guess, they can continue guessing up to the given number plus one.
            Neutral Word: Incorrect guess, end the turn.
            Assassin Word: Immediate loss.

    End of Turn: The turn ends either when the agent has made the number of guesses indicated by the clue or when they decide to stop guessing.

Winning and Losing:

    Win: Successfully reveal all red agents.
    Lose: Reveal the assassin card.

Strategy Tips:

    Use clues that can link multiple words to reduce the number of turns.
    Be mindful of words that might lead the agent to the assassin word.
    Consider the sequence and risk of revealing words to maximize the number of safe guesses.

By following these rules, you can enjoy Codenames in a cooperative 2-player format, working together to outsmart the game.

You play the red spy.
